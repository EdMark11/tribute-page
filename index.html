          <h1 id="title"><strong> LeBron James </strong></h1>
          <h2> About</h2>
          <p> LeBron 'King' James is a professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is often argued as the greatest basketball player of all time, alongside Michael Jordan. He has won 4 NBA Most Valuable Player awards and 4 NBA Championships with 3 different teams; Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat (2) and Los Angeles Lakers. He has been to 10 NBA finals, including a dominant run of 8 consecutive appearances (2011 - 2018).</p>
          
          <p>He is currently 2nd on the NBA all-time scoring list, on pace to beat the record in the 2022/2023 NBA season, and has the most points in the NBA Playoffs history.  He has 18 NBA All-star appearances and holds the record for most NBA All-team selections at 17.  LeBron finished the 2021/2022 NBA season averaging over 30 points per game, which is unheard of as prior to this feat the oldest players to achieve this average were 32 years old (Stephen Curry and Michael Jordan), this goes to show that not even father time can slow him down.</p>
